Model of harmonic composition in Western Tonal Music, based
on formalization of Minimalist grammar by Chris Collins and Ed Stabler:

Collins, C., & Stabler, E. (2016). A formalization of minimalist syntax.
    Syntax, 19(1), 43-78.

This model generates chord sequences via the assumption that the computational
system for Human Language and the computational system for Human Music are
actually the same. For more information, see:
